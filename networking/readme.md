# Connecting from On Premises to Azure VMware Solution

## Intro

Azure VMware Soltuion is physical hardware running in Azure datacenters managed by Microsoft.

To connect physical components to the Azure backbone we are using a technology called ExpressRoute.

Learn more about ExpressRoute [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/expressroute/expressroute-introduction).

As the Virtual Network Gateways connected to an ExpressRoute circuit can't transit traffic between two circuits (one circuit is going to on premisis, one is going to Azure VMware Solution) Microsoft uses the Global Reach feature to directly connect the on premisis circuit to AVS.
To learn more about Global Reach click [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/expressroute/expressroute-global-reach).

In certain cases the Global Reach feature is not available in all regions. Please look [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/expressroute/expressroute-global-reach#availability) to see where Global Reach is available.

A new product is [Azure Route Server](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/route-server/overview), it enables BGP connections with 3rdparty devices to exchange routes between Azure infrastructure components and appliances.

This guide should help you decide on the best possible network architecure for you.

## Azure VMware Solution Network Decistion Tree

The decision tree helps you take the right network design.
It is important that you think about the possible scenarios, that should be achieved using AVS.

One common use case is e.g. sending traffic through an NVA or propagate a default route to AVS for outbound internet traffic.
